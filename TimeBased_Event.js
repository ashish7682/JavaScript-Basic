/* 👉         JavaScript Timing Events

      *********************************************


 The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.

 These time intervals are called timing events.

 The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

 setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
 Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

 setInterval(function, milliseconds)
 Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.


 1️⃣ setTimeout()

 2️⃣clearTimeout()

 3️⃣ setInterval()

 4️⃣ clearInterval()..........*/
